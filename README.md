# Its a code for serial communication of Bits.
Its using 8051 microcontroller to transfer data bitwise using 8051 microcontroller.
The hardware used are 8051 microcontroller, data registers, and clocks for 8051 micro controller.
The code is written in Assembly language and can be tested and simulated in Proteus or ARM Micro Keil Software.
